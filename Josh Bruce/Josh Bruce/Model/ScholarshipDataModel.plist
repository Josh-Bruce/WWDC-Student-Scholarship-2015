		<string>Tossr is a small MVP for betting on a game of luck, 50-50 chance or winning with heads or tails. Josh worked on this application as freelance with a friend and it took approximatly one month to complete.

Tossr required realtime communication between the players using Pusher and data persistance using Parse this allowed for a very quick MVP to be created without having to build all the infrasture from scratch. </string>

		<string>Josh took part in the Student Scholarship for WWDC last year (2014) and was fortunate enough to have been awarded a ticket. This was an incredible moment in his life and was the most amazing feeling after putting in hours of effort in his application.

Josh learnt a great deal while at WWDC, getting hands on experience with the best engineers in the world, meeting some of the worlds greatest developers behind some of the App Stores greatest hits and having a fantastic time.

This was one of Joshs&apos; dream to visit San Francisco and Apple, this came true in June 2014 and I would love to attend the conference again. It was a fantastic learning experience.</string>

		<string>Josh is on a year long industrial placement with JustPark as an iOS Engineer helping build a brand new app written entirly in Swift. This is a complete re-write from their previos app. While Josh is here he has assisted with building this entirely new application in Swift which is available on the App Store and also about to release a WatchKit app to accompany it.

JustPark is the sharing economy of parking, allowing customers to rent out their driveways to people to park in, this has also expanded into hotels and airports. JustPark is an Index Venture and BMWi backed company who has also just recently secured a record breaking crowdfunding round raising Â£3.7 million from members of the public.

This has been an incredibly exiting year and Josh has learnt an incredibly amount while being in a buzzing startup. Everyone is motivated to the cause while also being interested by what all members of the team are doing.</string>

		<string>Josh started learning Swift from the minute it was announced on 2nd June 2014. Josh was lucky enough to be at the 2014 WWDC and was able to learn quickly alongisde many great developers and ask the engineers lots of questions about the new and exciting programming language Swift.

Swift is a fantastic new language with all the modern features, giving new developers to iOS a great starting point.</string>

		<string>Swiftcasts is currently being built and will hopefully become an incredibly useful resource for Swift and iOS developers. Providing up-to-date screencasts on the latest technologies and updates. Arregating a wealth of knowledge and building a fantastic community.

Swiftcasts will be aimed at all skill levels, ranging from new Swift/iOS developers to the veterans who have been developing on iOS for a long time.</string>

		<string>Josh took a summer internship at NeuroCoRe, a leading app development company within the medical field. Josh was working on ACEmobile while working here over the summer, a tool used to help diagnose patients with Alzimers earlier. ACEmobile is also attemping to replace the ACE-III paper test and becoem universally known as the tool to use when testing for Alzimers.

Josh also worked on a number of other minor tools which were in development, one of which was for Parkinsons. This was a tapping test to see if the patient could tap to a rythm with an audio cue as well as how fast they could tap. 

If I were to do another internship with NeuroCoRe I would help / like to encourage them to use ResearchKit to get their applications out to the masses to get great feedback and revolutionise the medical industry with technology.</string>
