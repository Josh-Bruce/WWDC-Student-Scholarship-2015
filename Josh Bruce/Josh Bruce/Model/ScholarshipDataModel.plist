		<string>Josh took part in the Student Scholarship for WWDC last year (2014) and was fortunate enough to have been awarded a ticket. This was an incredible moment in his life and was the most amazing feeling after putting in hours of effort in his application.

Josh learnt a great deal while at WWDC, getting hands on experience with the best engineers in the world, meeting some of the worlds greatest developers behind some of the App Stores greatest hits and having a fantastic time.

This was one of Joshs&apos; dream to visit San Francisco and Apple, this came true in June 2014 and I would love to attend the conference again. It was a fantastic learning experience.</string>

		<string>Josh took a summer internship at NeuroCoRe, a leading app development company within the medical field. Josh was working on ACEmobile while working here over the summer, a tool used to help diagnose patients with Alzimers earlier. ACEmobile is also attemping to replace the ACE-III paper test and becoem universally known as the tool to use when testing for Alzimers.

Josh also worked on a number of other minor tools which were in development, one of which was for Parkinsons. This was a tapping test to see if the patient could tap to a rythm with an audio cue as well as how fast they could tap. 

If I were to do another internship with NeuroCoRe I would help / like to encourage them to use ResearchKit to get their applications out to the masses to get great feedback and revolutionise the medical industry with technology.</string>

		<string>Josh started learning Swift from the minute it was announced on 2nd June 2014. Josh was lucky enough to be at the 2014 WWDC and was able to learn quickly alongisde many great developers and ask the engineers lots of questions about the new and exciting programming language Swift.

Swift is a fantastic new language with all the modern features, giving new developers to iOS a great starting point.</string>
